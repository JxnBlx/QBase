# Qbase Database

## Overview
Qbase is a C++ database designed to store stock ticker information, including timestamps and prices. It implements sharding based on stock tickers to optimize performance and scalability.

## Features
- **Sharding**: Data is partitioned based on stock tickers to distribute load and improve query performance.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast read and write operations.
- **Scalability**: Easily scales horizontally by adding more shards.

## Data Model
- **Stock Ticker**: Unique identifier for a stock.
- **Timestamp**: The time at which the price was recorded.
- **Price**: The recorded price of the stock.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- C++17 or later
- CMake 3.10 or later

<!-- ### Installation -->
<!-- 1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qbase.git
    ```
2. Build the project:
    ```sh
    cd qbase
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ``` -->

<!-- ### Usage
1. Initialize the database:
    ```cpp
    Qbase db;
    db.init();
    ```
2. Insert data:
    ```cpp
    db.insert("AAPL", "2023-10-01T10:00:00Z", 150.25);
    ```
3. Query data:
    ```cpp
    auto price = db.query("AAPL", "2023-10-01T10:00:00Z");
    ```

## Todo List for Implementing the Database

1. **Design the Schema**
    - Define the structure of the stock ticker, timestamp, and price data.
    - Plan the sharding strategy based on stock tickers.

2. **Set Up the Development Environment**
    - Install C++17 or later.
    - Install CMake 3.10 or later.
    - Set up the project directory and version control.

3. **Implement Core Functionality**
    - Develop the classes and methods for handling stock ticker data.
    - Implement sharding logic to distribute data across multiple shards.

4. **Optimize Performance**
    - Profile read and write operations.
    - Optimize data structures and algorithms for speed.

5. **Testing**
    - Write unit tests for all core functionalities.
    - Perform integration testing to ensure all components work together.

6. **Documentation**
    - Document the codebase for future contributors.
    - Update the README with installation and usage instructions.

7. **Deployment**
    - Set up a continuous integration pipeline.
    - Prepare the project for deployment in a production environment.

8. **Maintenance**
    - Monitor performance and scalability.
    - Address any bugs or issues that arise.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional query capabilities.
- Add support for more complex data types.
- Improve the sharding algorithm for better load distribution.
- Introduce caching mechanisms to speed up frequent queries.
- Enhance security features to protect sensitive data.
- Develop a graphical user interface for easier interaction with the database.
